Store: board, snakeLength, score, gameActive

Top-level:
- <Provider />: Provides the store as context for all child components
- <App />: Receives the store as a prop, is the top-level rendered component

Second-level:
- <GameStatus />: Container component, receives the score and active values from the store, and updates the title
- <GameTitle />: Presentational component, Displays when the game is lost, and the current score 
- <GameLayout />: Container component, it receives the board state from the store and calls GameBoard to display it
- <GameBoard />: Presentational component, it provides the display wrapper for GameLayout

Logic:
- A board space can have the values: 0, 1, 2, 3; where:
- - 0 is empty
- - 1 is a snake part
- - 2 is a mushroom
- - 3 is a wall
- If the snake "eats" a mushroom it grows by one, and the score increases
- if the snake "hits" itself or a wall, it dies and the game is over
