Snake - The Game. Built with ~~React and~~ Redux.

I tried to jump into the deep end of the pool with React and Redux.

...and hit my head on the bottom of the pool.

i.e. I couldn't figure out how to make it work. SOOO... since I started this 
project as an attempt to learn Redux and have some fun in the process, and since 
I have a mulish disposition at times, I'm going to try and make it work with 
Vanilla JS and Redux. The good-old-fashioned way!

We'll see how well this goes now won't we?
