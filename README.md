I've decided to trunk this porject for now. I can already see that it's going to be
a huge headache to get right, and I've got a good enough idea of the basics of Redux.
I think I'll learn more by moving on to something else. 

# Snake - The Game. 

Built with JavaScript & Redux.

## My main goals for this project are:
1. to learn how to use Redux for state management, and:
2. to develop the habit of writing unit tests as part of my workflow (I'm trying to do it at least *mostly* test-first)

## User stories:
- I open the page and see the empty game board, a title, and the start button
- When I press the start button a snake appears on the game board, and starts moving
- I can control the snake's direction with the left and right arrow keys
- I can colllect mushrooms which appear on the board, and when I do my snake gets longer, and my score increases
- If my snake runs into a wall or part of itself it dies, and the game ends
- When the game ends I can am given an opportunity to enter a name, and if I do my score is displayed on a high score
board with my score next to it
