Update: I knew I was jumping in over my head with this project, but I thought I would be able to work my way out of the weeds without too much trouble. As it turns out, I've been stuck on the same basic issues for the last week, and I'm out of ideas and patience for now. So I'm going to shelve this for a bit and do something else, to give my batteries a chance to recharge. 

Snake - The Game. Built with React and Redux.

Obviously, it's a bit overkill to use these tools for Snake, but that's the point. Build something simple with the tools to strengthen my understanding of them before trying something more significant. Besides, Reat and Redux are awesome together :D.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
