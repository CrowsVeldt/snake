I've decided to shelve this project for now. I don't think I will learn much more about Redux
from finishing it, and it will take more work than it is worth. So I'm going to move on to something
else. I definitely plan on finishing *A* snake game someday, whether it'll be this one or I'll start
over with different tools.

# Snake - The Game. 

Built with JavaScript & Redux.

## My main goals for this project are:
1. to learn how to use Redux for state management, and:
2. to develop the habit of writing unit tests as part of my workflow (I'm trying to do it at least *mostly* test-first)

## User stories:
- I open the page and see the empty game board, a title, and the start button
- When I press the start button a snake appears on the game board, and starts moving
- I can control the snake's direction with the left and right arrow keys
- I can colllect mushrooms which appear on the board, and when I do my snake gets longer, and my score increases
- If my snake runs into a wall or part of itself it dies, and the game ends
- When the game ends I can am given an opportunity to enter a name, and if I do my score is displayed on a high score
board with my score next to it
